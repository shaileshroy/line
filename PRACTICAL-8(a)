PRACTICAL-8(a): 
Write a program to do the following- 
i)	Enter a positive number N and find numbers a and b such that a^2-b^2=N. 
ii)	Find the gcd of two numbers using Euclidâ€™s algorithm. 
import math

# i) Find numbers a and b such that a^2 - b^2 = N
def find_a_b_for_N(N):
    for a in range(1, N):
        b_squared = a**2 - N
        if b_squared >= 0 and math.isqrt(b_squared)**2 == b_squared:
            b = math.isqrt(b_squared)
            return a, b
    return None, None

# ii) Find the GCD of two numbers using Euclid's algorithm
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Input a positive number N
N = int(input("Enter a positive number N: "))

# Find a and b for a^2 - b^2 = N
a, b = find_a_b_for_N(N)

if a is not None:
    print(f"a^2 - b^2 = N, where a = {a} and b = {b}")
else:
    print(f"No such a and b found for N = {N}")

# Input two numbers to find their GCD
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Find the GCD using Euclid's algorithm
result_gcd = gcd(num1, num2)

print(f"GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {result_gcd}")
